# Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Timer is a simple program that helps users increase their productivity by using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking down work into short intervals (usually 25 minutes) called "pomodoros", with short breaks in between. This program allows users to set their desired work time and break time and start the timer. The timer counts down and displays the remaining time on the screen. The program also includes a pause button and a reset button.

To use the program, simply run the script and enter the desired work time and break time in the format of "mm:ss" (minutes:seconds). Then press the "Start" button to begin the timer. Press the "Pause" button to pause the timer and the "Reset" button to reset the timer. The program will automatically switch from work time to break time and vice versa.

This program was created by OpenAI.
